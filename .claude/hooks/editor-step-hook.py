PostToolUse + Stop + UserPromptSubmit hook for editor mode step tracking.

Reads .codeyam/editor-step.json and prints a reminder about the current step.
Logs each firing to .codeyam/logs/editor-log.jsonl.
If no state file exists, outputs nothing (not in editor mode or between features).
Only fires when CODEYAM_EDITOR_ACTIVE=1 (set by terminal.rs in editor PTY sessions).

Step labels, descriptions, and restrictions are loaded from
.codeyam/cache/step-metadata.json, which is regenerated from

cache is the single source of truth — do not embed step tables here.
