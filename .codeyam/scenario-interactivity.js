// Hydration / interactivity probe for the headless capture browser.
//
// Background: a page can return HTTP 200, render visible content, log no
// console errors, and still be completely dead — the client framework never
// hydrated, so every button and handler is inert. The status / render /
// console / image gates all pass and the broken page sails through to the
// user (the catalog whose filter buttons did nothing). This probe asserts the
// page actually became interactive before the capture gate reports success,
// so a non-hydrating page can no longer pass `client-errors`.
//
// Stack assumption: WHICH framework's hydration we look for is data-driven
// from `.codeyam/stack.json` (or an explicit override) — never hardcoded into
// the capture flow. Stacks with no client runtime (backend services, CLIs,
// static HTML) are a documented no-op pass. Frameworks for which we have no
// reliable in-page attachment signal are ALSO a conservative pass: we never
// flag a page we cannot prove is dead, so a healthy Svelte / Solid / vanilla
// page is never a false negative. A new framework detector is a new entry in
// `detectors` below plus a `KNOWN_FRAMEWORKS` mapping — not an edit here; a
// meta-framework that hydrates an already-detected runtime is a new row in
// `META_FRAMEWORK_ALIASES`.

// Frameworks we have an in-page attachment detector for. Inference only
// resolves to one of these; an unrecognised framework yields `null`, which
// the caller treats as "cannot determine" (conservative pass).
const KNOWN_FRAMEWORKS = ["react", "vue"];

// Meta-frameworks mapped to the underlying runtime whose hydration detector
// applies. These do not carry their runtime's name in their stack identity: a
// Next.js app is `id: "nextjs-prisma-sqlite"`, `name: "Next.js + Prisma +
// SQLite"` — nothing contains the literal "react". Without this map the
// substring scan below returns `null`, the capture skips the hydration gate,
// and a genuinely un-hydrated page is reported as an inert control rather than
// as hydration never having run.
//
// Saying "Next hydrates React" is a fact about the runtime, not a framework
// assumption, so this stays consistent with the data-driven design above: a new
// meta-framework is a new row here, not a new branch in the capture flow.

// Bounded WAIT for hydration — the polling generalization of
// `probeHydrationState`. Where the probe reads the attachment state once,
// this re-polls `collectHydrationState` until the framework demonstrably
// attaches, the state becomes unjudgeable, or a wall-clock cap elapses. It is
// the seam the capture flow calls so that every screenshot and every driven
// interaction happens AFTER the client runtime has attached, not on inert SSR
// markup (the bug where a fill/click landed before React hydrated, the handler
// never fired, yet the run reported success).
//
// Stack-agnostic by construction: it resolves the same expectation as the
// probe, so a non-interactive stack (backend/static/CLI, or an explicit
// `capture.interactivity === false`) returns immediately with `hydrated: null`
// and never waits. An unknown framework (no detector) reads
// `frameworkAttached === null` on the first poll and also passes instantly — we
// never block on a page we cannot judge.
//
// Never fails closed: a timeout yields `hydrated: false` and lets the existing
// `interpretHydration` path decide whether to surface the loud `hydration`
// issue; a thrown probe (detached frame mid-nav) is caught and treated as a
// pass. The wait can never hang a capture (hard cap) and never turns a page we
// cannot prove dead into a failure.
//
// Honest limitation: the poll can only judge a page that has already rendered
// framework-owned controls. `waitForStablePage` runs first (its `rootUnpainted`
// guard waits for the SPA root to paint), so by the time this runs, content is
// present for the SSR case this guards; a pure-CSR shell that renders zero
// controls reads `null` and passes instantly, unchanged from today.
//
// Returns `{ hydrated, issue, timedOut, waitedMs, hasPasswordInput,
// credentialForm, formIsThePage }` where `hydrated` is the same three-valued
// signal `probeHydrationState` returns and the last three are the same password
// census it passes through — `null` for all three whenever no census was taken
// (a non-interactive stack, or a probe that threw on its very first poll).
